## Git, GitHub

Q1. What is the URL of the new GitHub repo that you created in your personal account? (not your class repo)
(https://github.com/Fola-b3/HW-1.git) This is the url of the repo i created and clone locally, i also made chages to one of the files locally and made changes to the other online.


Q2. In which direction does the 'pull' command work (does it send local changes to remote OR send remote changes to local)?

The pull command pulls changes made ong github.com and moves it locally.

Q3. If you have committed a change on your local machine, but do not see the update on GitHub.com, what step might have you forgotten?

If you do not see the update loccaly, you might have missed running the push command on your terminal.
